# üöÄ Getting Stared

## Set up development environment

1. install all packages

```bash
npm i
```

2a. serve ionic app _**(recommended)**_

```bash
npm run serve
```

2b. serve react app

```bash
npm run start
```

# Deploying To Device Using Capacitor/CLI

```bash
npm run ionic build
npm run  ionic cap sync ios
```

After you make changes to web code, you typically run the following command.

```bash
npm run ionic cap copy ios
```

After changes to native code/plugins

```bash
npm run ionic cap sync ios
```

Open up the IDE

```bash
npm run ionic cap open ios
```

Using Live Reload To Debug Application
When developing the remainder of the application, I used live reload commands which are listed below.

```bash
npm run ionic cap run ios -l --external

npm run ionic cap run android -l --external
```
