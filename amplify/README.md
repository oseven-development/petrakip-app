# Data model and API structure

Petrakip needs logical objects that complex data, such as images or videos, as part of their structure. For example, a Moment type can contain a picture. With AWS AppSync, we can model these as GraphQL types, referred to as complex objects. If any of the mutations have a variable with bucket, key, region, mimeType and localUri fields, the SDK uploads the file to Amazon S3 for you.
